## Introduction

Simply create a modern web component library by running the following...

```bash
# NPM
$ npm init @wcom/app <my-library>

# Yarn
$ yarn create @wcom/app <my-library>
```

Then follow the prompts and you'll be up and running in no time!

Once you are ready, simply create your first component and test inside `./src/components` and
then run `npm run transform`. From here the worlds your oyster, keep reading for some
more information on how this library works.

## IDE

If you're using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) then consider installing the following
extensions...

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [lit-plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=runem.lit-plugin)

## Build

The build script simply leverages TypeScript to do the work and outputs basic ESM exports
as Polymer suggests...

> We recommend publishing components as unoptimized JavaScript modules, and performing build-time
> optimizations at the application level. This gives build tools the best chance to deduplicate
> code, remove dead code, and so on.

## Lint

Linting is performed by [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and comes out of the box with simple
defaults...

- [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint)
- [eslint-plugin-wc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-wc)
- [eslint-plugin-lit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-lit)
- [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier)
- [eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort](https://github.com/lydell/eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort)

In addition, [lit-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-analyzer) is used to type-check
and lint `lit-html` templates with the same engine and rules as `lit-plugin`. Finally code is
formatted by [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

## Test

Testing is performed by the [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/guides/test-runner/getting-started).
Simply create `src/**/*.test.ts` files and run any `test:*` script. See their documentation for more
information.

## Release

Releases are automatically run by GitHub Actions and are processed by
[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release). Simply push to the
`release` branch when you want to create a `@latest` release, and push to the `next` branch when
you want to create a `@next` release.

See [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4) for commit
guidelines.

## Documentation

Documentation is automatically generated by the `transform` command (more information below) and
exists as a `README.md` file alongside your components. This is why it's recommended to create
your components in separate directories.

## Transform

The transform command uses [`@wcom/cli`](https://github.com/mihar-22/wcom-cli) to parse your
TypeScript files and collect metadata such as what properties, methods, events and other
information each component contains. This metadata can then be transformed into other formats
such as JSON and markdown. Click the link above for more information.
